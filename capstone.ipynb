        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Data Overview**: The dataset consists of 208 audio files (`.txt`) and their corresponding metadata files (`-info.txt`).\n",
        "*   **Metadata Parsing**: All metadata from the 208 `*-info.txt` files were successfully parsed into a pandas DataFrame with 23 columns. The parsing handled semi-structured formats, cleaned keys, converted numerical strings (including those with comma decimals), and processed \"NU\" values as `None`.\n",
        "*   **Audio Feature Extraction**: Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from all 208 audio files. For each file, a 13-dimensional feature vector was created by calculating the mean of MFCCs across time.\n",
        "*   **Data Integration**: The extracted audio features were successfully merged with the parsed metadata, resulting in a `combined_df` with 208 entries and 36 columns.\n",
        "*   **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
        "    *   Specific `object`-type columns intended to be numerical were converted to `float` type, correctly mapping \"None\" strings to `NaN`.\n",
        "    *   Missing numerical values were imputed: columns with partial `NaN`s were filled with their median, while columns entirely `NaN` (e.g., 'gramme\\_of\\_chocolate\\_eaten\\_in\\_\\_a\\_day' and 'soft\\_cheese\\_grams\\_per\\_day') were imputed with 0.\n",
        "    *   Missing categorical values (e.g., 'occupation\\_status') were imputed with 'Unknown'.\n",
        "    *   Numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler`, and categorical features were one-hot encoded using `OneHotEncoder`. The final feature set, `X_processed`, has a shape of (208, 116).\n",
        "*   **Target Variable Preparation**: Target variables for the neural network were prepared: `gender` was `LabelEncoded` (binary), and `diagnosis` was `OneHotEncoded` (25 classes). `age`, `vhi_score`, and `rsi_score` were used directly as continuous targets.\n",
        "*   **Dataset Splitting**: The processed data was split into training and testing sets with a 75/25 ratio, yielding: `X_train` (156, 116), `X_test` (52, 116), `y_train` (156, 5), and `y_test` (52, 5).\n",
        "*   **Neural Network Architecture**: A multi-output neural network was designed using Keras, featuring shared hidden layers (128 and 64 units) and five distinct output heads for `gender` (sigmoid, binary cross-entropy), `diagnosis` (softmax, categorical cross-entropy), `age` (linear, MSE), `vhi_score` (linear, MSE), and `rsi_score` (linear, MSE). The model has 25,117 trainable parameters.\n",
        "*   **Training and Evaluation**: The neural network was trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.\n",
        "    *   The model demonstrated learning, with training and validation losses generally decreasing and accuracies increasing.\n",
        "    *   Final test set evaluation showed an overall loss of 1.1032. Specific losses were: `gender_output_loss`: 0.6477, `diagnosis_output_loss`: 0.1152, `age_output_loss`: 0.1135, `vhi_score_output_loss`: 0.1030, `rsi_score_output_loss`: 0.2768.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current neural network architecture provides a good baseline for multi-task learning on this dataset. Further optimization through hyperparameter tuning (e.g., number of layers, units, learning rate, activation functions) and regularization techniques could improve predictive performance across all output tasks.\n",
        "*   Given the relatively small dataset size (208 samples), exploring data augmentation techniques for audio features or employing transfer learning from pre-trained audio models might be beneficial to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting.\n"
